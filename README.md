# CSPTranslator
# CSP Translator Project

This project aims to provide a CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) to natural language translation tool using ANTLR for parsing CSP files and Python for processing and translation.

## Project Structure

- **CSP.g4**: The ANTLR grammar file defining the syntax of the CSP language.
- **CSP.interp**: Intermediate file generated by ANTLR during parsing.
- **CSP.tokens**: Token definitions generated by ANTLR for the CSP language.
- **CSPLexer.interp**: Intermediate lexer file for CSP generated by ANTLR.
- **CSPLexer.py**: Lexer for CSP, generated by ANTLR.
- **CSPLexer.tokens**: Token definitions used by the lexer.
- **CSPListener.py**: Python listener for parsing the CSP syntax tree (generated by ANTLR).
- **CSPParser.py**: Parser for the CSP language, generated by ANTLR.
- **CSPVisitor.py**: Visitor class to traverse the parse tree of a CSP file.
- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).
- **app.py**: Main application file that runs the CSP translation service.
- **example.csp**: Example CSP file to demonstrate the translation process.
- **index.html**: Frontend HTML page for interacting with the CSP translator.
- **setup_antlr.py**: Script for setting up ANTLR on the system to generate the parser and lexer.
- **translate_ast.py**: Script to handle the translation from CSP abstract syntax tree (AST) to natural language.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or above
- ANTLR 4
- Required Python packages can be installed via `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
Setting up ANTLR
Download and install ANTLR 4 by following the instructions from the official website.
Use the provided setup_antlr.py script to generate the necessary lexer and parser files:

python setup_antlr.py
Running the Application
To run the application, execute the app.py file:


python app.py
You can interact with the translation service via the provided index.html page, which can be accessed after launching the web server.

Example
To test the translation service, use the provided example.csp file:


python app.py example.csp
This will parse the example CSP file and provide a translation in natural language.
